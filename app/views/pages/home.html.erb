    <p>CardSwipr helps you take attendance at meetings and events. Attendees swipe in with this easy interface, the application looks them up in the Yale Phonebook, and collects their information in a list. When the event's over you can even download a spreadsheet (.csv) output of the attendees' information.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>CardSwipr can quickly tell you about a person after they swipe their card. It can both take you to a person's Yale Phonebook entry and open a Service Now Incident with their name already filled out. This feature does not keep a list of everyone who was swiped, this is just for quick lookups. This is used in some Walk-In Centers around campus.</p>
