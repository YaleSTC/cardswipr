# CardSwipr
## Features
### Event Attendance
CardSwipr helps you take attendance at meetings and events. Attendees swipe in with this easy interface, the application looks them up in the Yale Phonebook, and collects their information in a list. When the event's over you can even download a spreadsheet (`.csv`) output of the attendees' information.

### General Lookup
CardSwipr can quickly tell you about a person after they swipe their card. It can both take you to a person's Yale Phonebook entry and open a Service Now Incident with their name already filled out. This feature is used in some Walk-In Computing Support centers around campus.
