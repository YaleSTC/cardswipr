{"name":"CardSwipr","tagline":"take attendance using Yale IDs","body":"## CardSwipr\r\nThis application helps you take attendance at meetings and events. Attendees swipe in with this easy interface, the application looks them up in the Yale Phonebook, and collects their information in a list. When the event's over you can even download a `.csv` output of the attendees' information.\r\n\r\n### More input than you need\r\nIn the same box, users can input any of the following \"unique identifying information\".\r\n\r\n- USB Magstrip Reader (registers as keyboard input)\r\n- USB Barcode Scanner (registers as keyboard input)\r\n- Keyboard \r\n  - NetID\r\n  - Yale Email\r\n  - UPI\r\n\r\n### More output than you'll use\r\nYou'll get the most useful information about your attendees from the Yale Phonebook, including:\r\n  - First Name, Nickname, Last Name\r\n  - Yale Email Address\r\n  - NetID\r\n  - UPI\r\n  - School\r\n  - College Name, College Abbreviation\r\n  - Class Year\r\n  - On-Campus Telephone (often inaccurate)\r\n  - On-Campus Mailing Address (often inaccurate)\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\nFor most input we just lookup the information in LDAP (the protocol powering the Yale Phonebook). This includes `netid`, `yale email`, and `upi`. We use the open source [YaleLDAP](http://github.com/YaleSTC/yaleldap) gem to make this easy. You could use this gem in your applications too!\r\n\r\nFor `magstrip` and `barcode` lookups we connect to a Yale database on the backend. This is more difficult for others to get access to, but we're working on an API that may become available to certain individuals who register with us.\r\n\r\n## About\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nLovingly created for the Yale Community by Casey Watts (@caseywatts), based on work by Adam Bray (@adambray).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have trouble or questions about this application, email the managers of the [Student Developer & Mentorship Program](http://yalestc.github.io) at `dev-mgt@yale.edu`.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
